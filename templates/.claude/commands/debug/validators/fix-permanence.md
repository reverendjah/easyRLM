# Validator: Fix Permanence

Permanence gate - fix must survive infra events.

---

## Survival Checklist

The proposed fix survives:

| Event | Survives? | Justification |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Docker container restart | [ ] YES / [ ] NO | |
| VM restart | [ ] YES / [ ] NO | |
| `/deploy` (build + push + reset) | [ ] YES / [ ] NO | |
| `terraform apply` | [ ] YES / [ ] NO | |
| VM destroy/create | [ ] YES / [ ] NO | |

---

## Manual Correction Gate

**IF** fix involved manual correction of config file:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is file generated by some process? | [ ] YES / [ ] NO |
| IF YES: Was the generating process fixed? | [ ] YES / [ ] NO |
| Does fix survive re-generation? | [ ] YES / [ ] NO |

**IF** any answer = NO:
- Fix is PALLIATIVE (will be lost)
- **REQUIRED**: Go back to Investigate
- ACTION: Read ~/.claude/techniques/flow-tracing.md (Step 4.1)

---

## Decision Gate

**IF** any item = NO:
- The fix is TEMPORARY (hotfix/palliative)
- Document: "This fix will be lost on [event]"
- **REQUIRED**: Implement PERMANENT fix that survives all events

**IF** all = YES:
- Proceed to implementation

---

## Red Flags

> **NEVER** declare a bug as "resolved" if the fix doesn't survive `/deploy`.
>
> Manual fix on VM is a HOTFIX, not a solution.
>
> Fixing config file WITHOUT checking generating process = bug returns on next deploy.
